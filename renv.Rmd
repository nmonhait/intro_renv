# Goal

Start thinking about reproducibility and project management  
Understand **one** of several tools available to you (open-source)

# Foundational knowledge

# Quick notes- projects

RStudio allows you to create "Projects" to organize code, data, and results within a directory. When you create a project, RStudio adds a file with the extension ".Rproj" to the directory

# Quick notes- projects  

Start a new project

# Quick notes- projects

Advantages to setting a directory to be an R project:

- Automatically uses the directory as your `current working directory` when you open the project 
- Coordinates well with `git version control` and `GitHub repository system`
- `Central location` for data analysis- files, scripts, output
- `Separate` from other work

---
class: rstudio-slide, left

# Quick notes- version control

Git is a *version control system* 

- `saves information` about all changes you make on all files in a repository
- allows you to `revert back` to previous versions
- `search through the history` for all files in the repository  

---

# Quick notes- version control  

Git is open source  
You can download it for different operating systems here:   

https://git-scm.com/downloads

GitHub helps you work with others on code

# Quick notes- version control

Collaborating  
- Different people have the ability to `push and pull` directly to and from the same repository  
- When one person pushes a change to the repository, other collaborators can `immediately` get the changes by pulling the latest GitHub commits to their local repository   

---
class: rstudio-slide, left

We recommend developers become familiar with both R project and version control before moving forward...

# Why?

---
class: rstudio-slide, left

# Common Challenges

Code from the past no longer runs  
Code only runs on your personal machine  
Broken code although no changes have been made 
Package updates break someone's code (worse if it's not yours!)

# How?

# Goals

Team collaboration and knowledge sharing   
Safe package upgrades   
*Reproducibility!*

# `renv()` package
---
class: rstudio-slide, left

# Overview

`renv` is a package created by RStudio to create reproducible environments
- private package library per R project
- take snapshots of the project library at different points
---
class: class: dark-gray, center  

#Workflow
---
class: rstudio-slide, left
# Installation  

```{r install, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("remotes"))
  install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("rstudio/renv")
```

---
class: rstudio-slide, left

# Getting started  

```{r init, message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
renv::init()
```
![](images/init.png)
- capture all packages used within R project  
- write .Rprofile to use private library on other systems
---
class: rstudio-slide, left
# Work!  


---
class: rstudio-slide, left
# Snapshot  

```{r snapshot, message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
renv::snapshot()
```
- save current state of R project library to a lockfile  

---
class: rstudio-slide, left  
# Work!


---
class: rstudio-slide, left  

#Restore 

```{r restore, message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
 renv::restore()
```
- restore state of R project library from a previous snapshot in your lockfile  

---
class: rstudio-slide, left

# `renv()` for Package Upgrades  

1. Analyst uses renv::init() to isolate the project library
2. Analyst uses renv::snapshot() to record current state
3. Package upgrades...
4. If something goes wrong, analyst can restore a previous environment
---
class: rstudio-slide, left

# `renv()` for Collaboration  

1. Analyst uses `renv` to create a renv.lock file using renv::snapshot().
2. Lock file is committed with code using Git.
3. Team member clones the Git repository into a new project with renv.lock file.
4. Team member uses renv::restore() to recreate the package environment.
